### Anchored spawn — how to send work out

A subagent starts with **none of your context**. That is what makes it cheap and what makes it
drift, so everything below exists to give it back exactly enough and no more.

**1. Persona.** Read `.bearing/domain.json` and give every subagent the SAME pinned persona bearing
resolved at install. Same in wave 2 as in wave 1, same in every unit of a fan-out — an expert that
changes between agents produces findings you cannot compare.

**2. Anchor.** Include the north-stars this task could actually violate — the relevant subset, not
the whole file. A subagent that never sees them will confidently contradict a settled decision, and
one that sees all of them pays that token cost once per agent.

**3. Bounds.** State the unit, what to return, and **what NOT to decide**. Whatever you leave
unstated, a subagent will decide anyway, using context it does not have.

**4. The same tool discipline you follow.** If this repo has the GitNexus module, a subagent must
use the graph — `query` to orient, `cypher` for structure — not grep. A subagent grepping for call
sites is doing the exact thing the gates exist to redirect, one level down where no gate can see it,
and what it brings back is the weaker kind of evidence.

**5. Parallel where the runtime allows it**, sequential where it does not. Claude Code can run them
concurrently; treat that as an optimisation, never as a requirement — the routine must produce the
same answer either way.

**6. Coverage is a claim, so keep it honest.** A subagent that died, timed out, or came back
empty-but-confused has REDUCED YOUR COVERAGE, and silence reads as "I checked everything". Re-run
it, or say plainly what went unchecked. Never let the count of agents you spawned stand in for the
count that actually reported.

**7. Tier follows the return contract.** A subagent that must REASON needs a capable model; one
that only GATHERS does not. Decide the tier from what you are asking it to return, never from
what the task feels like — and if a gatherer seems to need a smarter model, you have asked it to
reason and should take that part back.

**8. Spot-check before you trust.** Open at least one cited `file:line` per subagent and confirm it
says what the report claims. A fabricated citation is the one failure the return shape cannot catch
on its own.
